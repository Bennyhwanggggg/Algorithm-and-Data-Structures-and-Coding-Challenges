"""
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:

Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Expand Around Center

We observe that a palindrome mirrors around its center. Therefore, a palindrome can be expanded from its center, and there are only 2nâˆ’1 such centers.

You might be asking why there are 2n - 1 but not n centers? The reason is the center of a palindrome can be in between two letters. Such palindromes have even number of letters (such as "abba") and its center are between the two 'b's.

Time complexity : O(n^2) Since expanding a palindrome around its center could take O(n) time, the overall complexity is O(n^2).

Space complexity: O(1).
