Single Number III

Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

Example:

Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
Note:

The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

"""
Time complexity : O(N) to iterate over the input array.

Space complexity : O(1), it's a constant space solution.

create an array bitmask : bitmask ^= x. This bitmask will not keep any number which appears twice because XOR of two equal bits results in a zero bit a^a = 0

Instead, the bitmask would keep only the difference between two numbers (let's call them x and y) which appear just once. The difference here it's the bits which are different for x and y.

Let's do bitmask & (-bitmask) to isolate the rightmost 1-bit, which is different between x and y. Let's say this is 1-bit for x, and 0-bit for y.

fig

Now let's use XOR as before, but for the new bitmask x_bitmask, which will contain only the numbers which have 1-bit in the position of bitmask & (-bitmask). This way, this new bitmask will contain only number x x_bitmask = x, because of two reasons:

y has 0-bit in the position bitmask & (-bitmask) and hence will not enter this new bitmask.

All numbers but x will not be visible in this new bitmask because they appear two times.






The two numbers that appear only once must differ at some bit, this is how we can distinguish between them. Otherwise, they will be one of the duplicate numbers.

One important point is that by XORing all the numbers, we actually get the XOR of the two target numbers (because XORing two duplicate numbers always results in 0). Consider the XOR result of the two target numbers; if some bit of the XOR result is 1, it means that the two target numbers differ at that location.

Letâ€™s say the at the ith bit, the two desired numbers differ from each other. which means one number has bit i equaling: 0, the other number has bit i equaling 1.

Thus, all the numbers can be partitioned into two groups according to their bits at location i.
the first group consists of all numbers whose bits at i is 0.
the second group consists of all numbers whose bits at i is 1.

Notice that, if a duplicate number has bit i as 0, then, two copies of it will belong to the first group. Similarly, if a duplicate number has bit i as 1, then, two copies of it will belong to the second group.

by XoRing all numbers in the first group, we can get the first number.
by XoRing all numbers in the second group, we can get the second number.
